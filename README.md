# Time Series Viewers
----

This package allows users to visualize time series sequencing data (e.g. responses to external signals, developmental processes, cyclic internal 
processes, etc.)

What you get here is a trimmed down version of the visual components developed for the Genomics of the Glucocorticoid Response (GGR) project [https://github.com/alexbarrera/GGR-Visual](https://github.com/alexbarrera/GGR-Visual)
